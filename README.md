#Contexte : 
The COVID-19, also known as coronavirus disease 2019, is a viral illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus. It originated in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has since become a global pandemic, as declared by the WHO on March 11, 2020. Diagnosis of COVID-19 is typically done through RT-PCR testing, and chest X-rays can also be used to help with early detection of the disease.

#Dataset : 
It is a medical images directory structure containing Chest X-ray (CXR) Images of COVID19, NORMAL, PNEUMONIA. All images are preprocessed and resized to 256x256 in PNG format. 

The dataset is a multi classification, it has three labels COVID, NORMAL and PNEUMONIA. 

#Competition : 
Detect and classify COVID19 and Pneumonia from Chest X-Ray Images using Deep Learning methods.
